# Doku-s-RPG
A revival of a classic Minecraft texture pack

**About**:
------------
This pack is a continuation of Doku's RPG,
a texture pack by Doku, it was the initial inspiration for Gerudoku and several other remix packs, Doku's RPG was discontinued in 2010.

in 2014 Handsome_Dan started a continuation project called Doku RPG: Faithful Continuation,
it had a few items and new blocks, but was discontinued in 2015 due to lack of time,
most of Doku RPG: Faithful Continuation is used within this pack.

the original plan for this continuation was to avoid using anything made for Gerudoku and parts of Dokucraft, however I realized that I would never finish the pack if I didn't use a few parts from them, the original version of Doku's RPG didn't have items or mobs and the task of making nearly 14 years worth of textures all at once was a little too daunting, so I've tried to use as few as possible while updating the pack through each version of minecraft and trying to maintain a consistent style.
